Parsing Time: Learning to Interpret Time Expressions

----------
Abstract:
----------
We present a probabilistic approach for learning to interpret temporal 
phrases given only a corpus of utterances and the times they reference. 
While most approaches to the task have used regular expressions and similar 
linear pattern interpretation rules, the possibility of phrasal embedding 
and modification in time expressions motivates our use of a compositional 
grammar of time expressions. This grammar is used to construct a latent 
parse which evaluates to the time the phrase would represent, as a logical 
parse might evaluate to a concrete entity. In this way, we can employ a 
loosely supervised EM-style bootstrapping approach to learn these latent 
parses while capturing both syntactic uncertainty and pragmatic ambiguity 
in a probabilistic framework. We achieve an accuracy of 72% on an adapted 
TempEval-2 task -- comparable to state of the art systems.
