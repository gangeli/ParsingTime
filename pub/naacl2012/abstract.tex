We present a probabilistic approach to interpreting temporal phrases
	given only a corpus of utterances and the times they reference.
While most approaches to the task have used regular expressions and similar
	linear pattern interpretation rules, the possibility of phrasal embedding
	and modification in time expressions motivates our use of a compositional
	\textit{grammar of time expressions}.
This grammar is used to construct a \textit{latent parse} which
	evaluates to the time the phrase would represent,
	as a logical parse might evaluate to a concrete entity.
In this way, we can employ a loosely supervised EM-style
	bootstrapping approach to learn these latent parses while capturing both 
	syntactic uncertainty and pragmatic ambiguity in a probabilistic framework.
We achieve an accuracy of 71\% on an adapted \tempeval\ task --
	comparable to state of the art systems.
